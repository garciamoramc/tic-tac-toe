# Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" using React. It's primarily intended for educational purposes and serves as a practical exercise in web development.

### Project Overview
The project consists of a game board where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to align three of one's own symbols (traditionally 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### Technology Used
The main technology employed in this project is React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:
- Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/garciamoramc/tic-tac-toe.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd tic-tac-toe-react`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Additionally, install the 'react-confetti' package by running: `npm install react-confetti`

### What is react-confetti?

'react-confetti' is a React component that creates a confetti effect, commonly used to provide celebratory feedback or enhance user experience in web applications.

# Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. 
- Run the following command: `npm run dev`

This will start the development server and open the game in your default web browser.

# Gameplay
Click on an empty square to place your mark ('X' or 'O').
The game alternates between players after each move.
The first player to align three of their marks in a row wins the game.
If all squares are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
